# house-price-regression

This project is part of my independent study on building regression models (using scikit-learn in Python), based on the University of Washington's Coursera online class titled "Machine Learning: Regression". I used a dataset of house prices with different house features and built different models such as
multiple regression (file 1), polynomial regression (file 2), ridge regression (file 3), and lasso regression (file 4) to predict house prices. I learned the different pros and cons of different models depending on the datasets. I also explored machine learning concepts such as bias-variance tradeoff, gradient descent, coordinate descent, model performance analysis, cross validation, parameter tuning, feature selection, and statistical analysis of 
regression fit. Besides, I learned some mathematical foundation underlying regression using statistics, multivariable calculus, and linear algebra.
